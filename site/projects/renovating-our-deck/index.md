## Overview

We bought our house in 2018 and anticipated finishing the basement soon after moving in. We were expecting our first son, Lincoln, to arrive in July of 2020, which motivated us to complete it.


## Before

The basement was completely unfinished, with only concrete walls and floors. In one corner was a sump pump, and in the opposite corner was an existing storage area. Alongside the east wall, there was also a radon mitigation system. I ended up having to move a couple of HVAC vents before framing.

## Design
Here is the final design we submitted to the city for a permit. The main difference between this and the final build is that we decided to forgo putting in the bathroom to save on costs, though we did run electrical and plumbing for it. We also reduced the number of overhead lights.

## In-Progress

Shoutout to [Basement Finishing Man](https://www.youtube.com/c/basementfinishingman) on YouTube for teaching me how to frame a basement. For insulation, I used Rockwool since it's fireproof, moldproof, and an excellent sound dampener.

I ran coax and multiple CAT6a ethernet cables to every wall. My brother and I hung the drywall, but I had a contractor do the mudding and taping.

I had to cut and shorten every door since they were all positioned under soffits.

## After

Overall, I think it turned out quite lovely. We wanted something warm, and I absolutely detest the current cool grey trend. It's not 100% done in these pictures, but you get the idea...
