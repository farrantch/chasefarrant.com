## Overview
Many of you are probably familiar with the time-honored parent project of modding your kid's powerwheel cars. In the world of powerwheels, diversity in setup and configuration is as vast as the imagination of those who tinker with them.


&nbsp;
## Room for Improvement
One of the primary issues I've observed is the lack of customization and interoperability among different types of setups. The variations are numerous: some setups utilize Brushless DC (BLDC) motors, while others opt for brushless motors. The requirements for motor controllers also vary â€“ some setups need them, while others are directly driven. This disparity extends even to control mechanisms; while some enthusiasts prefer remote control, others find it unnecessary.

Another aspect that often goes overlooked is the scalability of powerwheels. Ideally, a powerwheel should grow with the child, evolving from a simple, safe setup suitable for a toddler to a more complex and thrilling ride for an older child. Unfortunately, most current setups fall short in this regard. The transition usually requires swapping out significant components, like the entire drivetrain or controller, which is neither cost-effective nor convenient. Integrating parts from different systems or making modifications often turns into a Herculean task.

What if you could easily mix and match components according to your needs, or switch between remote and manual control without overhauling the entire system?

## Introducing: OpenPowerWheels
OpenPowerWheels is an open-source Arduino project designed to address the limitations of traditional powerwheel setups. It features a modular design for easy interchangeability of components, including various motor types and control systems. Focused on technical adaptability, the project enables the powerwheel to be scaled and customized to suit different age groups and skill levels, providing a practical solution for progressive learning and technical development in ride-on toys.
