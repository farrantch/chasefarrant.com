# about me
Back in college, I used to play guitar in a band called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1XvxAZS5waAnVv4OEnZDVA" target="_blank">Catch Amy</a>. These recordings are from ~2012 and our album is _really_ more of a demo tape! I do miss writing and producing music. Hopefully, that is something I can get back to eventually.

I love the outdoors and I'm an avid snow skier and dirt biker. I have recently overhauled the 3 dirtbikes I used to ride growing up.

Finally, I love dabbling in side projects. If you have a project where you need DevOps or Cloud expertise, hit me up! I also have experience quickly spinning up backend APIs with python and FastAPI. You may have noticed that I am absolutely _not_ a front-end developer!
