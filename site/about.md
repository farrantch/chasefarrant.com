# About
By day, I'm an Engineer specializing in automation, cloud, devops, and backend development. I love to keep things simple, and this site is no exception.

After hours, I like to dabble in other projects that interest me. If you have a project needing DevSecOps or Cloud expertise, hit me up! I also have experience quickly spinning up backend APIs with Python and FastAPI. I am not a front-end web developer (in case it wasn't obvious). However, I embrace my weakness by utilizing simple design philosophies. This site is glued together with plain ol' HTML and CSS.

I love the outdoors and grew up snow skiing and riding dirt bikes. I recently overhauled the three dirt bikes I used to ride growing up.

Back in college, I used to play guitar in a band called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1XvxAZS5waAnVv4OEnZDVA" target="_blank">Catch Amy</a>. These recordings are from ~2012, and our album is really more of a demo tape. I do miss writing and producing music. Hopefully, that is something I can get back to eventually.
