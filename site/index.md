# Welcome
I originally started this site for fun and to document/share my work with others. However, it's now morphed into something bigger than that.

I'm now using this site to force myself to explore and learn more about topics before writing about them. If I cannot thoroughly convey my thoughts about a topic in a blog post, do I _really_ understand it well enough?

<!-- ## latest posts

<ul>
    {%- for post in collections.blog -%}
    <li>{{ post.data.date }}: - <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title }}</a></li>
    {%- endfor -%}
</ul>

<a href="/blog/">View all...</a>

## popular projects

<ul>
    {%- for post in collections.project -%}
    <li>{{ post.data.date }}: - <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title }}</a></li>
    {%- endfor -%}
</ul>
